Format specifiers are used for input-output (I/O) operations. With the help of a format specifier, the compiler can understand what type of data is in I/O operation.

There are some elements that affect the format specifier. They are as follows −

A minus symbol (-): Left alignment.

The number after % specifies the minimum field width. If the string is less than the width, it will be filled with spaces.

Period (.) − Separate field width and precision.
